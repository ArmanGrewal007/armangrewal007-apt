## Steps to install

> [!Caution]
> The Debian repo still needs to be hosted somewhere. üò≠

Assuming the repo has been hosted on this URL, export the hosted URL as a env variable
```
export ARMAN_URL="http://192.168.0.117:8000"
```

You can copy the following commands all at once, and paste in the terminal <br>
Most modern terminals can run them one by one by themselves
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] $ARMAN_URL stable main" | 
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian_arman.list
sudo apt update --allow-insecure-repositories
sudo apt install armangrewal007 --allow-unauthenticated
```
